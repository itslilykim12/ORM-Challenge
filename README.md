# ORM-Challenge
## Description 
This application was built with node.js and all the dependencies (express, mysql2, and sequelize) in order to simulate a back-end server for an e-commerce application. 
Using API routes, a user can GET all the informaton from a table or on a single item, create a new item through POST, update an item with PUT, or DELETE an item. 
## Installation 
1. Git clone the repository onto local machine. 
2. Run npm init and then npm install all dependencies (express mysql2 sequelize) in that order where the application is cloned at. 
3. Add the seed script in your package.json file 
4. Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create the database. 
5. create the .env file with proper credentials to sync the sql connection. 
6. Once the database has been created, use "npm run seed" in the terminal to insert data into tables.
